    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Creating devices for harsh, real-world environments is a significant challenge to research projects in the wearable and ubiquitous computing fields. In the pursuit of academic rigor, our papers often miss the hands-on experience we develop while building the actual hardware. While the devices we build are secondary to the research performed, the skills and techniques are common to many ubiquitous and wearable computing projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are not many venues to publish these experiences. DIY builder venues may not appreciate our narrowly focused requirements, while academic publication is not usually appropriate for the details of these engineering efforts, often only having room for a short description of the final version of the experimental setup. We might spend much of our time ruggedizing equipment for use with animals, ensuring user wear-ability and comfort, or just getting our hardware to survive the duration of a study, but these tasks can often get the least space in a paper. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this workshop, we will discuss how we built our devices, systems, and test setups. We will divulge our missteps, showcase our clever hacks, and share our favorite products. We will also discuss approaches to organizing our efforts when working between our collaborators' disparate fields of study and the field environments that might want to tear our hardware apart. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What did we create to perform the study? What did and didn't work? Where did we get the insight for the part that finally met the requirements? What combination of hardware from different sources made the difference?

    <h2>Workshop Topic Areas</h2>
    <p>
    In this workshop, members of the research community will share their unique field-deployed/deployable hardware systems, processes for designing solutions to the unique constraints their systems face, and their lessons learned from failed prototypes. This workshop will distill multidisciplinary information from across the Ubicomp and ISWC communities to expand the knowledge and capabilities of hardware developers working at research-scale. While the majority of our programming will draw from accepted 1-page extended abstract submissions, we will welcome attendance from the entire Ubicomp/ISWC community as an open-workshop.
